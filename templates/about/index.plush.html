      <h3>Our Manifesto</h3>
      <p><strong>The status quo is stagnation</strong>, most companies operate in maintenance mode—optimizing what exists, never questioning what could be. Internal innovation dies in endless meetings, buried under "not our core business" or "we'll just buy a tool for that."</p>
      <br />
      <p><strong>We believe every company deserves to be 1% better every day</strong>, empowering the people who know the problems best: your team.</p>
      <br />
      <p><strong>Internal hackathons unlock builder culture</strong>, when employees are given time, structure, and recognition to prototype ideas—whether it's automating a painful process, testing a new product concept, or upskilling in emerging tech—the entire organization moves faster. Teams stop waiting for permission. Innovation becomes routine, not rare.</p>
      
      <h3 style="margin-top: 32px;">Why Companies Struggle</h3>
      <p>Running internal hackathons shouldn't be hard, but it often is. Companies face:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Logistics overhead</strong> — Tracking teams, scheduling and follow-up becomes a full-time job</li>
        <li><strong>No clear outcomes</strong> — Ideas disappear after demo day with no path to production</li>
        <li><strong>Momentum loss</strong> — One-off events that never become repeatable culture</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 style="margin-top: 32px;">Our Solution</h3>
      <p>This service is <strong>simple, self-hosted, and built for internal use</strong>. 
      <br />Deploy it once. Run hackathons as often as you want. Track participants, teams, submissions, and outcomes in one place. Let your builders build.</p>
      
      <p>When anyone in your organization can prototype an idea, present it to leadership, and get green-lit for further development—you've created a competitive advantage that no vendor can sell you.</p>
